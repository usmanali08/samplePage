            A classic Norton motorcycle 1952 Lambretta 125 D scooter A motorcycle, often called a bike, motorbike, or cycle, is a two-
            or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long
            distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle
            and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. In 1894, Hildebrand
            & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle. In 2014,
            the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda, Yamaha (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp
            (India).[2] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel
            economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions,
            excluding car-centric Japan. According to the US Department of Transportation the number of fatalities per vehicle
            mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.</p>
